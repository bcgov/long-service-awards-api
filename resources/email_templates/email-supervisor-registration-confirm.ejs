                  Long Service Awards registration is open to any full-time,
                  part-time or seasonal employees who have reached a 25, 30, 35, 40,
                  45 or 50 year milestone with the BC Public Service by December 31,

                      recognized, can also register.

                <p>
                  Registration for the Long Service Awards may include a service pin.
                  If applicable, your employee's pin will be sent to you, the supervisor,
                  in early June for presentation during Public Service Week.

                </p>
                <h2>Ceremony</h2>
                <p>
                  The ceremonies will be held in Victoria this fall.
                </p>
                <% let nextCycle=service.cycle + 1 %>
                  <p>
                    If your employee has registered but cannot attend their ceremony, they may be eligible to
                    defer for one year and attend a ceremony in <%= nextCycle %>. Their award will be couriered to them
                      in the fall.
                      If they declined their last invitation, this is their final opportunity to attend.
                      If your employee contacts you to cancel their registration, please notify us at
                      <a href="mailto:LongServiceAwards@gov.bc.ca">LongServiceAwards@gov.bc.ca</a> or inform
                      your <a href="https://longserviceawards.gww.gov.bc.ca/contacts/">ministry contact</a> as soon as
                      possible.
                      Failure to provide a cancellation notice may affect their eligibility to defer to the following
                      year.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Travel and Time Off</h2>
                  <p>
                    Long Service Awards recipients from outside Greater Victoria must
                    be approved to take time off to attend their ceremony. Travel
                    costs, including transportation, hotel and meal expenses for the
                    recipient and one guest, are covered by the employeeâ€™s
                    organization.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For Victoria-based recipients, taxi expenses to and from their
                    ceremony are covered by their organization. In addition,
                    Victoria-based recipients must be provided a reasonable amount of
                    time to prepare for their ceremony. It is recommended recipients
                    are allowed to leave their workplace by 2 pm on the day of their
                    event without any negative impact to their pay. In cases where the
                    recipient is a front-line worker, arrangements for coverage should
                    be made in advance.
                  </p>
