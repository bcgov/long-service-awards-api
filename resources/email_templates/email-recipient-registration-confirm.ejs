                    <h2>Ceremony</h2>
                    <p>
                      The <%= service.cycle %> ceremonies will be held in Victoria this fall.
                        Your invitation will be emailed to you by the end of June and will include your ceremony
                        details.
                        Because each ceremony is tailored to host specific ministries and
                        organizations, it is not possible to change your ceremony date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      An email has also been sent to your supervisor confirming your registration.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Deferred attendance</h2>
                    <p>
                      If you register and are unable to attend the ceremony, the Long Service Awards team will courier
                      your award to you in the fall.
                    </p>
                    <% let nextCycle=service.cycle + 1 %>
                      <p>
                        Please note: you may defer your attendance for one year. You can register for next year's
                        ceremony in spring <%= nextCycle %>.
                          If you deferred your last invitation, this is your final opportunity to attend the Long
                          Service Awards.
